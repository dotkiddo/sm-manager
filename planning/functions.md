# Functions:

1. Feed aggregator
2. Delayed posting (futurepost)

## Feed aggregator:

What:
Display a merged view of subscribed feeds

Why:
How:
- via RSS or ATOM (where this is allowed)

When:
Where:

Brainstorming:
allow splitting columns up to view them side by side
an intelligent comparison -> if something is too similar about a post it should only be displayed once (DISTINCT) (regardless of origin) (display the occurrence count if the post appears more than once )

(social media, emails, newsfeeds (blogs), instant messaging platforms (whatsapp), SMS)

you need to be able to carry out the functionality of the original SM post as well (share, post, comment, react)


## Delayed Post

What:
allow the user to type a post/reply/comment etc and it must only be sent when the user specifies (timespan/datetime)
still needs to be a human element involved: no repetitive sending. (e.g. birthday messages)
